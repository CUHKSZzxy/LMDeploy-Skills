# E2E Efficiency Benchmark

Use this when the question is user-visible serving efficiency: throughput, TTFT,
TPOT/ITL, memory capacity, concurrency, or latency under a real API/server flow.
Pair with `triton-kernel-performance` only after the slow stage is known to be a
kernel. Use `e2e-accuracy-benchmark` for dataset correctness checks.

## Workflow

1. Create the run folder under the current source checkout's `benchmark/`
   directory. Follow `docs/local-conventions.md` for naming, summary, and
   artifact subfolder layout. If the user names a desired destination or run
   folder, put the benchmark folder there and state that path before long runs.
2. Record the exact matrix before running:
   - repo/commit, package import path, Python env,
   - model path and model alias,
   - backend, TP/DP/EP, quant policy or KV-cache dtype,
   - dataset, prompt count, input/output length policy,
   - GPU/node placement and server extra args.
3. Run one baseline and one candidate with the same workload. For KV-cache work,
   keep weight quantization separate from KV-cache quantization in labels.
4. Keep serving logs and benchmark logs under the same run directory. The log
   filename must encode model, parallelism, feature label, dataset, output
   length, and prompt count.
5. Summarize logs into CSV before drawing conclusions. Treat under 3-5%
   throughput deltas as noise unless reruns show lower variance.
6. If end-to-end performance regresses, split the problem:
   - server startup/model load,
   - prefill throughput and TTFT,
   - decode throughput and TPOT/ITL,
   - request scheduling/concurrency,
   - kernel-level cache fill/decode/attention.
7. Finish by writing `summary.md` in the benchmark folder. Keep it short, but
   include the model/config, workload, commands, key metrics, artifact paths,
   whether server errors occurred, fixes made, and caveats. Put key output
   data in Markdown tables near the top, before config and command details, so
   baseline/candidate deltas are easy to compare at a glance. The final
   response must include the run folder and exact `summary.md` path.
8. When comparing several LMDeploy candidates or feature variants, keep failed
   and skipped candidates in the same result set with concrete reasons. A readable
   "what we tried but did not select" table prevents later reruns from
   rediscovering the same bad command.

## Bundled Scripts

Copy or invoke the scripts from `scripts/`:

- `lmdeploy_config.sh`: editable benchmark config template.
- `lmdeploy_serve.sh`: start an LMDeploy OpenAI-compatible server with stable
  labels and logs.
- `wait_server.sh`: poll `/v1/models` with proxy disabled for localhost.
- `bench_sharegpt.sh`: run a ShareGPT-style API benchmark matrix.
- `bench_image.sh`: run a synthetic image+text API benchmark matrix through
  OpenAI chat-compatible multimodal requests.
- `profile_restful_api.py`: bundled OpenAI-compatible benchmark client; the
  config template points to this copy by absolute local path. It supports
  `sharegpt`, `random`, and `image` datasets.
- `api_smoke.py`: save deterministic OpenAI-compatible responses for quick
  baseline/candidate response-shape checks.
- `collect_bench.py`: parse benchmark logs into CSV and comparison plots.

Load `references/result-schema.md` when a local LMDeploy run needs normalized
JSONL rows or failed-candidate reporting beyond the baseline/candidate CSV
helpers.

```bash
INFRA_SKILLS_HOME=${INFRA_SKILLS_HOME:-/nvme1/zhouxinyu/common/Infra-Skills}

cd "$RUN_DIR"
# edit MODEL_PATH, MODEL_ABBR, TP, BACKEND, QUANT_POLICY

mkdir -p ./0_analysis

bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/lmdeploy_serve.sh" ./config.sh baseline
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/wait_server.sh" ./config.sh

Image quick-check layout:

```bash
INFRA_SKILLS_HOME=${INFRA_SKILLS_HOME:-/nvme1/zhouxinyu/common/Infra-Skills}
SKILL_DIR="$INFRA_SKILLS_HOME/skills/e2e-efficiency-benchmark"
MODEL_LABEL=qwen35_35b_a3b
RUN_DIR="./benchmark/e2e_${MODEL_LABEL}_image_quick"
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"
cp "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/lmdeploy_config.sh" "$RUN_DIR/config.sh"
cd "$RUN_DIR"
# edit MODEL_PATH, MODEL_ABBR, TP, BACKEND, QUANT_POLICY, PORT

bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/bench_image.sh" ./config.sh baseline
```

Local defaults on this machine:

- ShareGPT dataset: `/nvme1/shared/ShareGPT_V3_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json`
- Benchmark client:
  `$INFRA_SKILLS_HOME/skills/e2e-efficiency-benchmark/scripts/profile_restful_api.py`
- Fast matrix: `OUT_LENS=(None 2048)` and
  `NUM_PROMPTS=(1000 1000)`
- Medium matrix: `OUT_LENS=(None 2048 4096 8192)` and
  `NUM_PROMPTS=(1000 1000 500 200)`
- Full matrix: `OUT_LENS=(None 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768)` and
  `NUM_PROMPTS=(10000 8000 8000 4000 1000 500)`

Use `WORKLOAD_PRESET=fast` for quick agent benchmarks, `medium` for a more
useful development comparison, and `full` only when the server is stable and
the comparison is worth the runtime.

For image benchmarks, use `IMAGE_WORKLOAD_PRESET=quick` for a first agent check:
`IMAGE_INPUT_LENS=(100)`, `IMAGE_OUTPUT_LENS=(100)`,
`IMAGE_NUM_PROMPTS=(10)`, `IMAGE_RESOLUTIONS=(1024x1024)`, and
`IMAGE_COUNTS=(1)`. The image wrapper defaults to
`IMAGE_API_BACKEND_LABEL=lmdeploy-chat` and does not require `DATASET_PATH`,
because it generates synthetic `image_url` data URIs in the benchmark client.
Use `IMAGE_WORKLOAD_PRESET=fast` only after the server is stable.

Do not add `--log-level` by default. Normal LMDeploy serve logging is useful
and stays on disk because `SERVE_STREAM_LOGS=0` redirects stdout/stderr to the
serve log. Add `--log-level INFO` in `LMDEPLOY_EXTRA_ARGS` only when debugging
serve details. Use `SERVE_BACKGROUND=1` when a script should start the server
and return after writing a pid file beside the serve log.
Keep `BENCH_STREAM_LOGS=0` for larger benchmark matrices; the script still
prints the per-case log path before redirecting benchmark output.

For LMDeploy KV-cache quant labels:

- `QUANT_POLICY=0`: no KV-cache quantization.
- `QUANT_POLICY=fp8` or branch-specific numeric policy: FP8 KV cache if the
  checkout supports that CLI value.
- Keep exact quant labels for variants, such as `fp8` vs `fp8_e5m2`. The
  collector preserves `kvfp8_e5m2` as a distinct group, so compare it with
  `--candidate-group kvfp8_e5m2` rather than folding it into `kvfp8`.

Keep model weight dtype in `MODEL_ABBR`. Use `FEATURE_LABEL` for non-KV
feature toggles; the scripts encode it as `feature-<label>` so the collector
can group it.

## Acceptance

Before reporting a win, provide:

- exact serve and benchmark commands,
- summary CSV or table with baseline and candidate,
- Markdown tables for key output metrics at the top of `summary.md`,
- failed, skipped, or SLA-failing candidates when a matrix tried more than the
  selected baseline/candidate pair,
- one short response-shape check if changing output-affecting behavior,
- whether the run measured only API macrobenchmarks or also kernel/profiler
  evidence,
- run folder and exact `summary.md` path.
